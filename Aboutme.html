<p> My name is Dimitri Entien I am curently studying at Borough of Manhattan Community Colege (BMCC), CIS major. </p><br/>

<p> When I started attending BMCC, It was the first time I ever attened an American school. I was blow away by the vast amount of resources available to faclty and students. At first i was afraid to speak to anyone and use the resources available to me. However, with time, I was able to make friends and with that came a ton if fun activities with the resources available to us. </p><br/>

<p> At a young age I gained an intrest in working with Computers. I knew that when I grew up, that I would love to work in a technological area. </p><br/>
<p>I believe that this generation will be strongly dependent on technology for its advancement for the future. </p><br/>
